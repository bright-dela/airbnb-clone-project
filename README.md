# Airbnb Clone Project  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack application designed to simulate the development of a real-world booking platform, similar to Airbnb. This project emphasizes backend architecture, database design, API development, and application security, while also exploring CI/CD practices for efficient deployment.  

The goal of the project is to gain hands-on experience in building scalable, secure, and collaborative software systems using modern technologies and best practices.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals  
- Develop a scalable backend architecture for a booking platform.  
- Gain proficiency in **team collaboration** using GitHub.  
- Design and document a relational database system with MySQL.  
- Implement **secure APIs** following industry standards.  
- Explore **CI/CD pipelines** for automated deployment and testing.  
- Strengthen skills in project planning, documentation, and execution.  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Backend Framework**: Django  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **API Development**: Django REST Framework / GraphQL  
- **Version Control & Collaboration**: Git & GitHub  
- **Containerization**: Docker  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (or similar CI/CD platforms)  

## ðŸš€ Key Highlights  
- **GitHub Repository Management**: Learn how to structure and maintain a professional project repository.  
- **Team Role Documentation**: Understand and define the roles of different contributors in a collaborative environment.  
- **Database Design**: Create and document a relational schema reflecting real-world requirements.  
- **Feature-Driven Development**: Identify and implement core features critical to a booking system.
