- Design and document a relational database system with MySQL.  
- Implement **secure APIs** following industry standards.  
- Explore **CI/CD pipelines** for automated deployment and testing.  
- Strengthen skills in project planning, documentation, and execution.  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Backend Framework**: Django  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **API Development**: Django REST Framework / GraphQL  
- **Version Control & Collaboration**: Git & GitHub  
- **Containerization**: Docker  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (or similar CI/CD platforms)  

## ðŸš€ Key Highlights  
- **GitHub Repository Management**: Learn how to structure and maintain a professional project repository.  
- **Team Role Documentation**: Understand and define the roles of different contributors in a collaborative environment.  
- **Database Design**: Create and document a relational schema reflecting real-world requirements.  
- **Feature-Driven Development**: Identify and implement core features critical to a booking system.  
- **API Security**: Apply modern security practices to safeguard data and transactions.

## Team Roles

Building a scalable application like the Airbnb Clone requires a collaborative effort across multiple specialized roles. Each role contributes unique skills and responsibilities to ensure the success of the project.

### 1. Backend Developer
Responsible for designing and implementing the server-side logic, APIs, and integrations with the database. Ensures data flows correctly between the frontend and backend systems.

### 2. Frontend Developer
Focuses on creating the user interface and user experience of the platform. Implements responsive designs and connects with backend APIs to display data effectively.

### 3. Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs, manages, and optimizes the relational database structure. Ensures data integrity, security, and efficient query performance across the system.

### 4. DevOps Engineer
Sets up and manages CI/CD pipelines, deployment environments, and containerization (e.g., Docker). Responsible for system reliability, scalability, and automation.

### 5. Security Engineer
Implements and monitors security measures such as authentication, authorization, data encryption, and secure API practices to safeguard user data.

### 6. Project Manager
Coordinates team activities, defines timelines, and ensures that milestones are met. Facilitates communication and keeps the project aligned with objectives.

### 7. QA Engineer (Tester)
Responsible for testing the application to identify and report bugs. Ensures the system meets functional and non-functional requirements before deployment.

### 8. UI/UX Designer
Designs wireframes, prototypes, and user flows. Ensures the product is intuitive, visually appealing, and user-friendly.

---
Each of these roles plays a critical part in delivering a production-ready, scalable web application. Together, they ensure the project is functional, secure, and user-centered.


## Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone project is built using a modern technology stack that ensures scalability, performance, and maintainability. Below are the key technologies and their roles in the project:

### 1. Django
A Python web framework that powers the backend of the application. It helps in building RESTful APIs, handling authentication, and managing server-side logic efficiently.

### 2. Django REST Framework (DRF)
An extension of Django that simplifies the process of creating robust and secure REST APIs. It enables smooth communication between the frontend and backend.

### 3. PostgreSQL
A powerful relational database used to store structured data such as users, bookings, listings, and reviews. PostgreSQL ensures data integrity and supports complex queries.

### 4. GraphQL
An alternative query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. This makes the application more efficient and flexible compared to traditional REST endpoints.

### 5. Docker
Used for containerization, making it easier to package the application and run it consistently across different environments (development, testing, and production).

### 6. Git & GitHub
Version control tools used to manage code changes and collaborate with the team. GitHub serves as the central repository for storing and reviewing project code.

### 7. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Core web technologies for building the frontend. They ensure that the user interface is interactive, responsive, and visually appealing.

Each of these technologies works together to create a full-stack application that is scalable, secure, and user-friendly.
